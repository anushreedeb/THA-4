Research question: How can Domestic Violence be calculated for India?

Dataset: DHS India 2015 -16.

The Demographic and Health Survey, administered by the DHS Program, is funded by the USAID and conducts locally administered health and demographic surveys across several countries. In India, the DHS Surveys are administered under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, coordinated by the International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, and implemented by groups of survey organizations. Within DHS, I have specifically looked at DHS_Birth Recode, which looks at health and demographic data for infants and children and includes questions which measures attitudes, perceptions and incidences of domestic violence. There are a total of 7 variables within birth_recode which are important for calcuating a domestic violence index for India. I calculate an index using PCA analysis in STATA. The important codes are explained in the data dictionary and the process is explained in the do file and log.

The .dta file has been renamed to birth_recode for ease of use. The dataset has been uploaded on google-drive and the link to access it is below https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pj6io71D3k4gKKZE0y-YJ6Bmb3Yg3V-H
